0.9.8 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Almost at v1.0 quality for my tastes
	- BLOCK_(INCOMING/OUTGOING)_RFC1918 options to help sure up security of LAN space leakage
	- Changes to LANDHCPSERVER so it accepts interface names, plus a possible fix for win7
	  hammering DHCP server for unknown reason?
	- Cleanups
	- No longer display list of blocked IPs, considering if they are
	  as long as my list is, they'll take 4 pages to display...
	- New block file format, much more capable now, thanks to
	  an hour or two of improving my bash scripting skills to the
	  point where I can do more complex breakdowns of formats
	- Rename blocked to ipv4-blocked since we're going to have
	  ipv6 support
	- ipv6 blocking support.  Different format for config file
	  because IPv6 uses :, which means we get to use | for both
	  ipv4 and ipv6 (goes against a previous commit)

0.9.7 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Support for marking packets, uses new config file and
	  IPv4_MARK file option
	- MULTI-NIC-ARP-LOCK hack added, to fix what I consider to be an annoying 'feature' of
	  arp requests on Linux
	- Allow use of multiport iptables module to reduce amount of rules

0.9.5 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>

	- stop-firewall for...  stopping the firewall!
