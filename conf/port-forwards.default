# External interface:Src IP:External IP:External port:Internal ip:Internal port
# You can safely leave the interface field blank as well as the Src IP and External IP field blank
# However, you need to define at least the interface or external IP or you probably will have issues.
# Rename this file to port-forwards before using!
